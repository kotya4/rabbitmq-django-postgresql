    django initialized according to https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/intro


    postgresql used as db engine


    do not forget to create db first, use " CREATE DATABASE alytics ; "


    checkout postgresql settings in alytics/alytics/settings.py -> DATABASES
    there is my local username/password you might want to change as well

    app name is "polls" as it is in https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/intro
    but routed as /
